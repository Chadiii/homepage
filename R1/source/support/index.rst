Getting Help
============

If you need help with Varnish and the docs give you no clue on what
to do there are several options available to you.

Mailing lists
-------------

The varnish-misc list is open for questions.

There are other lists available as well, but those have other
purposes. See `Mailman <https://www.varnish-cache.org/lists/mailman/listinfo>`_ for a complete listing.

IRC Channel
-----------

Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the multiuser, real time instant messaging service, is available. A lot of Varnish users hang out here and help is often given in a friendly manner. You need to connect to the channel #varnish on the server irc.linpro.no.

Social Media
------------

In addition to the old school mailing list and IRC channel, Varnish
is also discussed in a number of social media. Here is a overview:

* Stack Overflow, where there is a varnish tag
* Linkedin has a group on Varnish Cache
* Twitter is a good place to reach us out. You can find us as @varnishcache

Commercial support
------------------

Please see the :ref:`business` page.
