VUG5 Description
----------------

| **Travel &
Accommodation: **\ Check \ `Hotels.com <http://www.hotels.com>`__ and
see \ `this
link <https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VUG5#GeneralInformation>`__ for
transport help.
| **Registration:** The meeting is free of charge, but it requires
registration, which is now closed.

Varnish User Day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of the User Day is for users to share their experiences with
the community and voice their current and future needs to the
development team. As you may have experienced, Varnish solves many
challenges in the web today and will help you solving problems in the
future. Obviously, this is something members of our community would like
to know more about. So yes, this meeting will have presentations and
even slides, but we look forward for it to be an useful in-depth meeting
about Varnish, most likely topped off with some cold beer at the end of
the day.

Varnish Dev Day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After gathering feedback and having discussed with the community, **the
developer group of Varnish Cache and Varnish modules aka VMODs** will
gather to discuss and shape the future of the forthcoming 3.1 and 4.0
releases. **As this meeting can be highly technical and kind of boring
for others than the hardcore C-developing hackers of Varnish, the Dev
Day is for Developers only.**
