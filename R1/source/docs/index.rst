Varnish Documentation
=====================

The official documentation contains a **install guide**, a **tutorial**
and a **reference**.

We're trying to keep the official documentation in sync with the code.
Both are kept in same source repository and both are available online:

-  `Documentation for the latest release
   4.1 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.1/>`__
-  `Documentation for the stable release
   4.0 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/4.0/>`__
-  `Documentation for version
   3.0 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/>`__ (unsupported)
-  `Documentation for version
   2.1 <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/2.1/>`__ (unsupported)
-  `Documentation for the current development
   version <https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/>`__ (git master)
