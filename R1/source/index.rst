Privacy
-------

You can access the varnish-cache homepages with HTTP or HTTPS as you
like.

We save the logfiles from our Varnish instance for a limited period,
in order to be able to debug problems.

The old homepage ran Google Analytics, and we have continued that here
for now, but unless we actually learn something useful from the data
they collect, it will be discontinued.
