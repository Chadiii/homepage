:ref:`I'm new here, please explain this Varnish thing <intro>`

:ref:`Questions and Answers<faq>`

What is happening
-----------------

2017-11-15 - Security Advisory: (Unlikely) data leak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain uncommon configurations of Varnish may leak data in
synthetic responses from `vcl_backend_error{}`

Please see :ref:`vsv00002`

We have released Varnish 4.1.9 and 5.2.1 to fix this issue.

2017-09-15 - Varnish 5.2.0 is released

Come and get it... :ref:`rel5.2.0`


2017-08-02 - Security Advisory: Denial of Service

All varnish versions from 4.0.1 are vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack, please see :ref:`vsv00001`

2017-08-02 - Security releases: 4.0.5, 4.1.8 and 5.1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Varnish versions 4.0.5, 4.1.8 and 5.1.3 are now available. See
:ref:`vsv00001` for details.

Package repository status
-------------------------

The official Linux (apt/yum) package repositories are now located
at Packagecloud.io.
A list of all available repositories can be found at:
https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache

The old http://repo.varnish-cache.org/ is going to be removed on the 31st of August.

For more details on packages, see :ref:`Releases & Downloads <releases>`

Privacy
-------

You can access the varnish-cache homepages with HTTP or HTTPS as you
like.

We save the logfiles from our Varnish instance for a limited period,
in order to be able to debug problems.

The old homepage ran Google Analytics, and we have continued that here
for now, but unless we actually learn something useful from the data
they collect, it will be discontinued.
