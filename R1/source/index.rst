:ref:`I'm new here, please explain this Varnish thing <intro>`

What is happening
-----------------

2021-03-15 - Varnish 6.6.0 is released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our bi-annual"fresh" release is here:  :ref:`rel6.6.0`

(The 2021-09-15 release is likely to be 7.0.0)

2020-11-06 - Varnish 6.0.7 is released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are happy to announce the release of :ref:`rel6.0.7`.

This maintenance release is recommended for all users of the 6.0 LTS
and contains several bug fixes, improvements and new features. More
information is available in the
`Change log <https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/blob/6.0/doc/changes.rst>`_


2020-09-25 - Varnish 6.5.1 is released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When preparing the 6.5.0 release, it was forgotten to bump the
VRT_MAJOR_VERSION number defined in the `vrt.h` include file. This major
version bump is needed due to the API and ABI changes as part of the
release, to make sure that VMODs are not allowed used if they were
compiled for the wrong Varnish version.

This has been fixed in the :ref:`rel6.5.1` release.
