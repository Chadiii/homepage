Finding things
--------------

Where is the bug I opened in 2012?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we migrated to github, we created placeholder tickets, so if you
know the ticket number go to:

	https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/42

for a suitable value of 42.

If you don't know the ticket number,
`search github for closed issues <https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed>`_
