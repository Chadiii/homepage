Anders Berg

Blame Anders!  He is the one who got the crazy idea that the world
needed another HTTP proxy server software, and convinced his employer,
the norvegian newspaper `Verdens Gang <http://www.vg.no>`_ to pay for the
first version to be developed.

Here is an interview with Anders about `how it all began
<http://info.varnish-software.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-varnish-cache-qa-with-the-man-behind-the-idea>`_

Poul-Henning Kamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHK, as he's usually known, has written most of the code and come up with
most of the crazy ideas in Varnish, and yet he still has trouble
remembering what 'REST', 'CORS' and 'ALPN' means, and he flunked
'CSS for dummies' because he was never a webmaster or webdeveloper.
He does have 30+ years of experience in systems programming, and
that seems useful too.

PHK's `random outbursts </docs/trunk/phk/index.html>`_ has their own
section in the varnish documentation.
