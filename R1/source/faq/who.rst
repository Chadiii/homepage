Who is ... ?
------------

Anders Berg
~~~~~~~~~~~

Blame Anders!  He is the one who got the crazy idea that the world
needed another HTTP proxy server software, and convinced his employer,
the norvegian newspaper `Verdens Gang <http://www.vg.no>`_ to pay for the
first version to be developed.

Here is an interview with Anders about `how it all began
<http://info.varnish-software.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-varnish-cache-qa-with-the-man-behind-the-idea>`_

Dag-Erling Smørgrav
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DES was working at Redpill-Linpro, a norwegian UNIX/Open Source company
when Anders floatet his idea for a "forward HTTP cache", he lured PHK 
into joining, was one of the original developers (doing Linux), project 
manager and release engineer for the first three years of the project.

Poul-Henning Kamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHK, as he's usually known, has written most of the code and come up with
most of the crazy ideas in Varnish, and yet he still has trouble
remembering what 'REST', 'CORS' and 'ALPN' means, and he flunked
'CSS for dummies' because he was never a webmaster or webdeveloper.
He does have 30+ years of experience in systems programming, and
that seems useful too.

PHK's `random outbursts </docs/trunk/phk/index.html>`_ has their own
section in the varnish documentation.

Per Buer
~~~~~~~~

Per also worked at Redpill-Linpro, and at somepoint the impedance
mismatch between Linpros "normal way of doing things" and the
potential of Varnish became to steep, he convinced the company to
spin off `Varnish Software <https://varnish-software.com/>`_
with himself at the helm.

Do a git blame on the Varnish documentation and you will be surprised
to see how much he cares about it. Very few people notice this.

Ingvar Hagelund
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ingvar works as Team Leader (read very skilled sysadmin) at Redpill-Linpro, 
but his passion is reading books and blogging about it, as well as RPM 
packaging. So every Fedora and EPEL (read RedHat and CentOS) Varnish user
out there owe him a thanks or two. Once in a while, he also trawls the 
internet checking for the rate of Varnish adoption among top web sites.

Stig Sandbeck Mathisen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stig works at Redpill-Linpro and is the guy in charge of packaging Varnish 
for Debian, which means Ubuntu users owe him a thanks also. Besides this,
he maintains vcl-mode for emacs and is generally a nice and helpful guy.


Tollef Fog Heen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tollef was product owner and responsible for Varnish while working
for Redpill-Linpro. later tech lead at Varnish Software and held 
the Varnish release manager helmet for a few years. His experience with
open source (Debian, Ubuntu and many others) brought sanity to the 
project in ways that are hard to measure or describe.

Kristian Lyngstøl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kristian was the first Varnish SuperUser, and he quite literally
wrote the book, while giving Varnish courses for Redpill-Linpro,
and he pushed boundaries where no boundaries had been pushed before
which caused a lot of improvements and "aha!" moments in Varnish.

Artur Bergman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Artur ran Wikias webservers and CDN when he discovered Varnish and
eagerly adopted it, causing many bugreports, suggestions, patches
and improvements.  At some point, he pivoted Wikias CDN into the
Varnish based startup-CDN named `Fastly <http://www.fastly.com/>`_

Kacper Wysocki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kacper was probably the first VCL long program writer. Combine this with
an interest in security and a job at Redpill-Linpro and he turned 
quickly into the author of security.vcl and, later, the Varnish Security 
Firewall. He does not have any commits in Varnish and still has managed 
to drive quite a few changes into the project. Similarly, he has no idea 
or has even thought about asking for it, and still is being added here.
He maintains the VCL grammar in BNF notation, which is an unexploited 
gold mine.

Nils Goroll
~~~~~~~~~~~

aka 'slink' is the founder of `UPLEX <http://uplex.de/>`_, a five-head
tech / consultancy company with negative to zero marketing (applied
for entry into the "Earth's worst company homepage" competition). He
fell in love with Varnish when he migrated Germany's Verdens Gang
counterpart over a weekend in March 2009 and, since then, has
experienced countless moments of pure joy and happiness when, after
struggling for hours, he finally understood another piece of
beautiful, ingenious Varnish code.

Nils' primary focus are his clients and their projects. He tries to
make those improvements to Varnish which matter to them.

Martin Blix Grydeland
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Martin was the first full-time member of the C-team at Varnish Software. 
He is the main responsible for the amazing revamp of the Logging 
facilities and utilities in the 4.0 cycle and later the Stevedore 
rework. Besides that he fixes lots of bugs, knows varnishtest better 
than most, writes vmods and is the Varnish Cache Plus architect.

Federico G. Schwindt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Federico used to keep an eye on the Varnish port for OpenBSD before 
joining Varnish Software. Most of his contributions are patches 
here and there and bug fixes which make sure that planned project 
changes and reality are aligned. Of all committers he is the one that 
takes out more LoC than he adds. He has written a few VMODs. He has 
started writing more language bidnings and VMODs that he has published.
