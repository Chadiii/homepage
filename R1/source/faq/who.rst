Who is ... ?
------------

Anders Berg
~~~~~~~~~~~

Blame Anders!  He is the one who got the crazy idea that the world
needed another HTTP proxy server software, and convinced his employer,
the norvegian newspaper `Verdens Gang <http://www.vg.no>`_ to pay for the
first version to be developed.

Here is an interview with Anders about `how it all began
<http://info.varnish-software.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-varnish-cache-qa-with-the-man-behind-the-idea>`_

Dag-Erling Smørgrav
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DES was working at Redpill-Linpro, a norvegian UNIX/Open Source company
when Anders floatet his idea for a "forward HTTP cache", he
lured PHK into joining, and managed the project during its infancy.

Poul-Henning Kamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHK, as he's usually known, has written most of the code and come up with
most of the crazy ideas in Varnish, and yet he still has trouble
remembering what 'REST', 'CORS' and 'ALPN' means, and he flunked
'CSS for dummies' because he was never a webmaster or webdeveloper.
He does have 30+ years of experience in systems programming, and
that seems useful too.

PHK's `random outbursts </docs/trunk/phk/index.html>`_ has their own
section in the varnish documentation.

Per Buer
~~~~~~~~

Per also worked at Redpill-Linpro, and at somepoint the impedance
mismatch between Linpros "normal way of doing things" and the
potential of Varnish became to steep, he convinced the company to
spin off `Varnish Software <https://varnish-software.com/>`_
with himself at the helm.

Kristian Lyngstøl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kristian was the first Varnish SuperUser, and he quite literally
wrote the book, while giving Varnish courses for Redpill-Linpro,
and he pushed boundaries where no boundaries had been pushed before
which caused a lot of improvements and "aha!" moments in Varnish.

Artur Bergman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Artur ran Wikias webservers and CDN when he discovered Varnish and
eagerly adopted it, causing many bugreports, suggestions, patches
and improvements.  At some point, he pivoted Wikias CDN into the
Varnish based startup-CDN named `Fastly <http://www.fastly.com/>`_

Nils Goroll
~~~~~~~~~~~

aka 'slink' is the founder of `UPLEX <http://uplex.de/>`_, a five-head
tech / consultancy company with negative to zero marketing (applied
for entry into the "Earth's worst company homepage" competition). He
fell in love with Varnish when he migrated Germany's Verdens Gang
counterpart over a weekend in March 2009 and, since then, has
experienced countless moments of pure joy and happiness when, after
struggling for hours, he finally understood another piece of
beautiful, ingenious Varnish code.

Nils' primary focus are his clients and their projects. He tries to
make those improvements to Varnish which matter to them.
